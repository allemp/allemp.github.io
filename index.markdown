# Meet Aleksander

I am an applied machine learning engineer/data scientist from Helsinki, Finland. I enjoy good movies, good food at home and walks in the forest with my dog.



## My dog

My dog is a ~5 year old Finnish Spitz called Reksi. Favorite things are running at full speed in the woods and barking at squirrels and ducks.
